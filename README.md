# shopify-store

## Description
This project project was created to help the user obtain, create, update and delete information with Insomnia. I have used the following technologies for this backend project: express.js, node.js and MySQl

## Installation
Open up the integrated terminal and enter npm i to install your dependencies. Then run mysql -uroot to start MySQL. And then enter soucre db/schema.sql to create a database then type exit. Now you can seed your database with data by typing npm run seed. Once it's seeded, you will need to type npm start so it could be listened by port 3001. Then you can open insomnia and check out what was created for the backend
